Welcome to LinkedDeepDict's documentation!
==========================================

A Lightweight Python library to manage nested dictionaries with 
parent-child relationships. On top of being a compatible drop-in replcement 
of the build in ``dict`` class, the self replicating default factory makes the 
creation of complex nested layouts effortless. The library also provides a collection
of useful algoritms for parsing of nested dictionaries. This architecture
of data is exploited in many ``DewLoosh`` projects.
